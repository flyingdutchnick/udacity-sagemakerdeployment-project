# udacity-sagemakerdeployment-project

In this project we construct a recurrent neural network for the purpose of determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. We create this model using Amazon's SageMaker service. In addition, we deploy the model and construct a simple web app which will interact with the deployed model.

The following files are included:

- The SageMaker Project.ipynb file with fully functional code, all code cells executed and displaying output, and all questions answered.
- An HTML or PDF export of the project notebook with the name report.html or report.pdf.
- The completed train/train.py and serve/predict.py python files.
- The edited website/index.html file
